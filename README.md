# local-heights
Code for "Local heights on hyperelliptic curves and quadratic Chabauty" by L. Alexander Betts, Juanita Duque-Rosero, Sachi Hashimoto, and Pim Spelier.

This code computes local heights h_ell for odd ell not equal to p on hyperelliptic curves of the form y^2 = f, where f is monic and even degree.

A basic example
--
```
_<x> := PolynomialRing(Rationals());
f := x^6 + 2*x^4 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^2 - 6*x + 1;
p := 3;
X := HyperellipticCurve(f);
cd := ClusterData(f, p : prec := 20);
G := ConstructDualGraph(cd);
HeightsAtRationalPoints(G, M, X);
```

Detailed examples for how to use the code can be found in the examples folder.


Prerequisites
--
Magma (this code has been tested on Magma V2.27-1 and V2.28-3).
